# this script details the mapping of fields from various tables from the Insektmobilen project (2017-2020, Denmark) to DwC-A v2. Much of the data is already shared in the current DwC-A format (occurrence core with multimedia, DNA-derived, eMoF extensions) here: https://www.gbif.org/dataset/cb8a261a-66cb-4068-809e-9e773359bb30.  

# the data will be mapped as survey class and contains morphological IDs, DNA metabarcoding derived IDs, material gathering, citizen science sampling and land cover and land use information.
