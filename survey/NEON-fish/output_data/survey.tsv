Ten sampling reaches or segments are established at each site; with 3 fixed reaches sampled during every bout and a random subset of 3 additional reaches or segments selected for sampling each year. Fish are sampled using primarily electrofishing at both lakes and streams. Gill-nets and mini-fyke nets are additionally deployed in lake sites, once per segment per sampling bout.	Monahan, D. 2021.

Sampling bouts should not be longer than 5 days long assuming no weather or other unexpected schedule delays. Typically one bout can be managed by 2 staff. Person hours can be calculated from start times, end times and number of staff in a sampling pass.
